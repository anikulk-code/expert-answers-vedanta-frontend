# Expert Answers — Vedanta

Structured project context for future threads, planning, implementation, and review.

## One-line product summary

Expert Answers helps users ask natural-language spiritual questions and receive trustworthy, timestamped pointers into Swami Sarvapriyananda Q&A videos, rather than generic web-search summaries. There is another tab where the same answers can be explored by snippets. And we want to build another tab where geeta verses will be mapped to specific lectures.


## Repositories

- Backend: `expert-answers-backend`
  - Python FastAPI
  - Azure Cosmos DB for questions, topics, embeddings, queue/upvotes
  - Vector search plus topic/entity search
  - OpenAI for matching, filtering, and related behavior
  - YouTube Data API for thumbnails and some legacy helpers
- Frontend: `expert-answers-vedanta-frontend`
  - React
  - Main tabs: Search and Explore by Topic
  - Optional Debug tab only when `REACT_APP_ENABLE_DEBUG=true`
  - API base from `REACT_APP_API_URL`, otherwise falls back to the deployed Azure API URL


## What is shipped today

### Main answer flow

User asks a natural-language question.

The frontend calls:

`GET /api/answers/v1?question=...&count=...`

The API returns JSON containing:

- `answers`
- optional `queueInfo`
- optional `userMessage`

Answer objects follow the `AnswerResponse` shape and may include:

- `videoLink`
- `time`
- `speakers`
- `date`
- `thumbnail`
- `questionTitle`
- `playlistId`

### Search semantics

- Primary retrieval uses the curated Q&A database.
- Main answer matches prefer items that have a `video_link`.
- Related-question and upvote-oriented paths may include questions without videos where that split is relevant.

### No-match behavior

There is no current-product fallback that searches YouTube for a random or approximate video.

If there is no strong Q&A hit, the product should move the user toward:

- related questions
- queue / upvote behavior
- explicit low-confidence or no-answer messaging

It should not pretend it found a valid answer when it did not.

### Explore by Topic

Topic browsing is supported through:

- `GET /api/tags`
- `GET /api/tags/{tag}/questions`
- `GET /api/tags/search`

Tags are driven by Cosmos/topic logic. A static JSON file is not the runtime source of truth.

### Thumbnails

Thumbnails are often loaded progressively in the Explore UI via:

`GET /api/thumbnails/{video_id}`

This keeps list endpoints fast and reduces unnecessary YouTube API pressure from the server side.

### Caching

Pre-canned questions are defined in:

`app/services/llm_service.py`

Specifically:

`PRECANNED_QUESTIONS`

These questions receive in-memory caching for expensive matching work.

The full answer response is also cached in:

`app/routers/answers.py`

This supports fast, idempotent repeat requests.

### Header/source link

The frontend header includes a Source link to the AskSwami playlist:

`AskSwami Q&A | Swami Sarvapriyananda`



## Current mental model of the system

### Backend responsibilities

- Receive natural-language questions
- Retrieve likely matches from the Q&A corpus
- Rank or filter using vector/topic/entity logic plus LLM-assisted behavior
- Return answer objects with video metadata and timestamps
- Support related-question and queue/upvote flows
- Serve topic browsing endpoints
- Serve thumbnails on demand

### Frontend responsibilities

- Search experience for asking questions
- Explore-by-topic browsing experience
- Optional debug surface behind env flag
- Progressive loading of thumbnails where appropriate
- Source link back to the AskSwami playlist

## Important non-goals for current-state discussions

Do not describe the following as part of the live core product unless a specific implementation is confirmed:

- generic YouTube search fallback as the normal no-match path
- static JSON as the source of truth for topics
- multi-expert comparison or viewpoint selection
- fully automated transcript parsing pipeline

## Ops and deployment notes

- Cosmos firewall/networking matters in production. Azure-hosted API access to Cosmos must be correctly allowed, otherwise production can fail even when local development works.
- Frontend CI can fail on ESLint warnings when `CI=true`, so warnings should be treated seriously in PR checks.

## Roadmap framing

Use this language when discussing roadmap versus shipped behavior.

### Historical / legacy

- v0-style YouTube Search exploration may exist historically or in utilities.
- It is not the core product path today.

### Current product phase

- v1 is the curated Q&A plus matching system.
- Runtime source of truth is Cosmos DB.
- Ingestion scripts or JSON files may still exist under `ManualScripts` or data folders, but they are not the runtime authority.

### Future

- v2 automatic transcript/parse pipeline is future work.
- Richer scoring, multi-expert selection, and same-vs-different-viewpoint experiences are future product dimensions.

## Recommended short context prompt for future threads

Use the following when you want a concise but accurate project setup summary:

> Expert Answers is a product that answers user questions by returning trustworthy, timestamped segments from expert YouTube Q&A videos rather than generic generated summaries. This deployment is the Vedanta / Swami Sarvapriyananda experience. The backend is a FastAPI service backed by Azure Cosmos DB for questions, topics, embeddings, and queue/upvotes, with vector/topic/entity search plus OpenAI-assisted matching/filtering. The frontend is a React app with Search and Explore by Topic tabs, plus an optional Debug tab behind `REACT_APP_ENABLE_DEBUG=true`. The main shipped flow is `GET /api/answers/v1?question=...&count=...`, which returns answer objects such as `videoLink`, `time`, `speakers`, `date`, optional `thumbnail`, `questionTitle`, and `playlistId`, plus optional `queueInfo` and `userMessage`. Primary retrieval uses the curated Q&A database and prefers items with video links. If there is no strong match, the product should favor low-confidence messaging and related-question/queue-upvote UX, not a generic YouTube fallback. Topic browsing uses `/api/tags`, `/api/tags/{tag}/questions`, and `/api/tags/search`, with Cosmos/topic logic as the source of truth. Thumbnails are often fetched progressively via `/api/thumbnails/{video_id}`. Pre-canned questions in `app/services/llm_service.py` and response caching in `app/routers/answers.py` are important performance details. Do not describe historical YouTube-search behavior, multi-expert comparison, or automatic transcript parsing as shipped unless implementation is confirmed.

## Recommended working rules for future collaborators

- Distinguish clearly between shipped behavior, legacy utilities, and roadmap.
- When in doubt, optimize for answer quality and trust rather than answer coverage.
- Preserve the no-fake-confidence principle.
- Treat Cosmos as the runtime source of truth unless a task explicitly concerns ingestion or migration.
- Assume the product is single-expert Vedanta unless the task explicitly expands scope.
